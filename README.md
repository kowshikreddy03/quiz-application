**Task Description:**
During my internship at CODTECH IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd., under the mentorship of Neela Santhosh Kumar, I was assigned to develop an Interactive Quiz Application as part of the Front End Development module. The project involved building a user-friendly web application that dynamically loads questions, provides instant feedback on answers, and calculates the final score.

The application was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports dynamic question loading from a predefined array, enabling easy updates and scalability. Users can answer multiple-choice questions with immediate visual feedback indicating whether their response is correct or incorrect, thereby enhancing the learning experience.

Key features include:

A scoring system that tracks the user's correct responses and displays the final score.

A timer for each question, promoting timely decision-making.

A polished user interface with clear visual hierarchy, intuitive button placement, and responsive design.

An option to restart the quiz upon completion.

This project helped me improve my skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and front-end design principles. It also gave me practical experience in creating dynamic, interactive web applications that are both functional and visually appealing.

Overall, this internship task enhanced my understanding of frontend development workflows and user-centric application design, preparing me to handle future projects involving interactive web technologies.
